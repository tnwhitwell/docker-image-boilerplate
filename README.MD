# Docker image boilerplate

This is a boilerplate, defining how I build my own docker images.

I believe it adheres to existing best practices, but as-per GPL3,
there is no guarantee!

The Dockerfile requires a few updates to get it actually working - I
hope to have indicated these well enough that someone would be able
to identify them at a glance at the file.

Some Sample Dockerfiles are included in the [examples](examples)
directory.

## Readme Badges

You can add various badges, generated by [microbadger](https://microbadger.com/#badges).
As the images created with this template Dockerfile are labeled with
the [label-schema.org](http://label-schema.org/) labels, all available
microbadger badges should work OTB.

## Projects using this template

Some existing projects that are building with these principals
for reference.

### Projects actually building using this

These are projects with docker build pipelines based on this template.

* [scnewma/nest_exporter](https://github.com/scnewma/nest_exporter)
* [tnwhitwell/apcups-influx](https://github.com/tnwhitwell/apcups-influx)

### Projects I am building from other repositories

These are projects which either do not have sensible docker builds
already, have no existing automatic docker build, or I just wanted
to make my own image.

* [tnwhitwell/speedtest_exporter](https://github.com/tnwhitwell/speedtest_exporter)
* [tnwhitwell/docker-sslh](https://github.com/tnwhitwell/docker-sslh)

## Rubbish Readme admission

I'm terrible at writing Readmes. Hopefully this is sufficient, but I
always accept PRs / Issues if not.
